Your spaceship has crashed on a volcanically active planet!
You must collect 5 rocket pieces (r) and make your way to your rocket (R)
before the whole planet floods with lava!

Mountains (M) will reveal far spaces, but take time to climb!
If you step on spikes (+) take a dip in a hot spring (â–’) to heal yourself!


The precompiled binary should work in a Unix terminal or Windows Command Prompt, or you can compile it yourself with the included makefile.
